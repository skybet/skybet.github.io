Sky Betting & Gaming Engineering Site
=====================================

This is source for our public engineering site at http://engineering.skybettingandgaming.com, rendered via [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) through GitHub Pages.

## How to Contribute

1. Fork it (https://github.com/skybet/skybet.github.io/fork)
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. [Submit a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)

All changes are welcome from additional articles, to styling changes, etc. If you're not comfortable with a pull request you can email <engineering@skybettingandgaming.com> directly with your post in [Markdown format](https://help.github.com/articles/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/) with any accompanying pictures.

If making updates to the layout, use the sass in the `_scss/` directory.

## Adding a New Article

To add a new article you need to add a new file in [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) format in the `_posts` directory following the naming conventions of the existing files. The file will need to include [Jeykll front matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) like this:

    ---
    layout:     post
    title:      Your Title Here
    date:       2015-08-05 15:45:00
    summary:    Your summary here.
    author:     author_name
    image:      post_image.png
    category:   Category
    tags:       comma, separated, tag names
    ---

You should add any images used in the post to the `images` directory.  If the post has a main image you wish to appear on the homepage and in any post previews, you should add it with the name referenced in the frontmatter.

If the article is in a brand new category, simply run `bundle exec rake createCategory["CATEGORY NAME"]` or manually update `_data/categories.yml` and create a category file in `category/`.

If an article has been created by multiple authors, you can specify the `author` key as a list (using hyphens as the list item marker), instead:

    ---
    author:
     - author_key
     - another_author_key
    ---

### Style Guide

* The company name should always be referred to as "Sky Betting & Gaming"
* In markdown files such as posts, you don't need to encode html entities (e.g. ampersand). In HTML, you do.
* Post headings should start at `h2` (`##`, as the post title will be the `h1`) with a properly nested hierarchy.
* Take note of formatting/capitalisation of different framework/languages (e.g. JavaScript, Node.js); we aim to be consistent with the formal documentation for that framework/language.

### Images

If you wish to use an image within the post, reference them in markdown like so:

    ![Shuffled Lego](/images/lego-shuffled.jpg)

### Videos

Videos should be hosted on the [SB&G Engineers YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKhLYGIGTBiD-9zyGkDwfDA).

### Authors

For the `author` key, if you have not posted before, you should create a corresponding entry in `_data/authors.yml`, using the alias used in the post frontmatter as the key, e.g.

    author_name:
        name: Author Name
        image: author_name.png
        role: Author's Role / Squad
        tribe: Author's Tribe
        startDate: 01-05-2015
        bio: Some information about the author, can be as long as you like, but should be written in proper English.
        interests: Comma, Separated, Interests, List
        twitter: optional_twitter_handle
        github: optional_github_account

Again, add the author's image to the `images/authors` directory with the same filename as referenced within the author definition, and make sure it's 100x100 pixels: all author information will be included into each of the appropriate posts made by the author, as per `_includes/author.html`.

## Rendering the Site Locally

To render the site locally, first you need to `sudo gem install bundler`. Then you can `cd` into your cloned repository and run `bundle install` to install all the rubygems which Github Pages (where the site gets hosted) uses, for compatibility reasons.  The site itself is powered by [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).  You can then run `bundle exec rake` (which calls `jekyll serve`) which will result in the site being available on `http://127.0.0.1:4000/`, re-rendering if you make any changes.  If you have any trouble getting the gems to install (particularly within OS X's default environment), we recommend installing [rvm](https://rvm.io).
