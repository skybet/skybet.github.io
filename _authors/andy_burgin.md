bio: "Andy is a Lead Platform Engineer at Sky Betting and Gaming. He considers himself a Kubernetes and Hadoop fettler, spending a far too much of his spare time making Raspberry Pis do things they shouldn’t. He was a small part of the organising team for DevOpsDays London 2019 and has been runing the Devops meetup in Leeds for 6 years hosting over 50 events. He’s attended and spoke at a bunch of DevOps conferences and in his own words is ‘an all round DevOps nuisance’."
