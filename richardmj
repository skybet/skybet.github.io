I wonder what's worse. A google review in the first week, where customers don't really know and thus aren't looking. We'll soon switch on the marketing and your reviews will be lost to the ether.
Or a life time of github commits on sky public repos?
What's this repo really for - to help graduates and other candidates i suppose.
and you're happy they'll find out about your dirty tactics?
