I have never published an article before this!

Despite having lots to say, I have until now never shared my thoughts with the world and recently I've begun to ask myself why…

I reasoned that what had historically held me back was a pathological fear that my offering would prove to be incomplete, or lacking a conclusion, ill thought through, biased, contradictory or simply put ‘not finished’.

And then it occurred to me. In a world of MVP, just in time, hack days and short feedback loops is the requirement for a finished item an unnecessarily self-imposed constraint……? Finished implies a defined end, and even if there is a defined end (highly debatable and worthy of a separate discussion) attempting to reach it before involving others is not only arrogant but wildly anti collaborative, anti-lean and anti-agile.

You may be able to relate.

When sending a message to a group I can generally come up with the draft content in minutes, if not seconds. But I spend infinitely longer tying up loose ends and making sure my communication is polished, often at the expense of my original point.

With this in mind I decided to pay closer attention to my own behaviour and was surprised to notice that I was spending 20% of my time on content or a first draft, and 80% of my time adding polish. This also didn’t take into account anything I drafted but didn’t share as I felt the draft was insufficiently complete for general consumption.

So I began to ask the question, does the real world require finished items? Well obviously in some cases such as heart surgery, or the mechanics of aeroplane landing gear deployment, here I accept that a finished product is highly desirable. But in the vast majority of cases no it doesn’t, particularly in the creative knowledge industries such as IT product development.

Successful businesses such as SB&G need people who can communicate ideas and engage the thinking of others, then work collaboratively across specialisms to identify next steps. Nothing in IT product development ever really gets finished. At any given point you are simply looking at the latest iteration!

So why don’t we stop putting ourselves and our colleagues under pressure to finish things, let’s agree now that ‘not to finish anything again’ is morally preferable and economically sensible. I myself will always be happy with timely 90% draft, be it a presentation, demo or product feature pitch, and I’m certain I’m not alone.

Crazy you say! Well let’s consider the potential advantages

* If 80% of our time is spent delivering the unrequired last 10% we will become 5 time more efficient overnight
* We could communicate more ideas and be more open if we aren’t corseted by our fear of communicating the incomplete, or wrong
* If the ideas we communicate require input to finish them, we encourage engagement, which will arguably result in better and more rounded solutions

This could be the answer! And will appeal to anyone of us who has stayed late staring at a set of presentation slides adjusting margins and pointlessly re writing content after going word blind.

If the communication of ideas is our aim and liberation from the perfect pitch is something we covert, then let’s have more draft ideas and more to the point, let’s have them now!
