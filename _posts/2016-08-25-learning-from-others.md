As part of out first ever "Learning and Development Week" at Sky Betting and Gaming I decided to do a blog. It's all about how I have taken lessons from other people that I can now bring to SB&G to be part of Making Betting and Gaming Better...

> "Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful people with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent."

My Dad keeps this quote from 30th US President Calvin Coolidge in his wallet ever since I was very small. He'd even laminated it and I always thought it was cool without really understanding what it meant. The first time it really hit home was when I went to university to study architecture. Trouble was, I can't draw. That's not me being modest - I'm genuinely dreadful at it. Can do smiley faces and semi-decent cats but that's not too helpful when you've got to relandscape Todmorden with an eco-friendly building built in it. 

All my mates were so much better than me and it was hard. The only two benefits I got from my actual studies at Manchester was getting the tick in the box at having a degree after 3 years and I once got a point once in a pub quiz on a question about what does DPC mean? (Damp proof course - I still remember that lecture - scintillating stuff)

I had a part-time job at uni at Emporio Armani where I proudly manned the till and chatted away with customers. I must have folded thousands of t-shirts and served plenty of stars  from Man Utd, Man City and Hollyoaks. Cor! The glamour. Here I learnt how much I loved working in a team and being customer facing.

> It's there where I met Matt Persse - who taught me the value of being passionate about your product. When talking to anyone about our product "you have to believe in it Haguey or they won't" he'd say to me.

I would listen to him talk to our customers about jumpers and say zingers like "Look at this double-stitched-Persian-cross-weave Sir - breathtaking"..... it was all made up banter.... but his passion came across in spades and customers duly bought things no matter what "weave" he conjured up that day. Being passionate about whatever you did (in my case folding t-shirts) was key. Matt is now a successful tattoo artist in Stockport with his Bee Tattooed parlour.

> As I knew I wasn't going to be the next Frank Lloyd Wright I popped my degree on my CV and started looking for jobs. I thought retail was for me and at 21 I started as a Graduate Trainee with Morrisons working on every section of the store for about 6 months. I found the graft important and very satisfying. The 4.45am alarm calls to get to work to work to open the fish counter were hard but I loved it. From putting on the ice to making displays out of trout..... my girlfriend at the time didn't enjoy me discovering fish scales glued to me after a long day at work - but it was rather satisfying peeling them off and flicking them across the room.

She didn't stay around long after that - odd really.

> The message from Paul Kelly - General Manager of Morrisons Guiseley at that time was to value the contribution of everyone in the whole Guiseley team. Everyone thinks their job can be hard but he wanted me to learn more about other people’s roles and recognise that they are all key to our success.

Waitrose came calling a few years later with an offer of more senior management roles. Tony Kavanagh - Branch Manager of Waitrose in Wolverhampton - told me that as a leader you can earn respect by making informed decisions rather than deciding things just “for the sake of it” or to make a point.

> Togetherness, collaboration and engaging with the team were characteristics he championed. You can always make more considered decisions this way rather than ‘shooting from the hip’. He would always say “it’s not about your team always listening to you… it’s about you listening to your team’….. I thought that was an incredibly profound statement from him and had no idea he’d nicked and tweaked a JFK speech!
 After operations I was became a customer service trainer touring the nation and opening new shops. After this I designed some collaborative training with John Lewis, then became a Regional Training Manager working in distribution (sheds and trucks - brilliant fun) Before managing a large team across that did great work across the country and the hundreds of Waitrose branches we had.

The thing I took from these adventures and working with tonnes of people was all about authenticity. Be yourself - something i'd not always done too well. I had tried (unsuccessfully) to 'be what I thought "a company wants you to be'....I was on a hiding to nothing with this and changed tack.

Authenticity is a great characteristic to have and should be embraced. Be yourself and feel comfortable with who you are. Don't try and be what you think someone else wants you to be as ultimately this will not work. Stay true to your values and beliefs as these are integral to what makes you you. 

I know I'm no genius (or drawer) but I'll always persevere and get up for an eighth time when I've been knocked down the seven before. 

I do know that I will always listen to other people - their views, knowledge and feedback... because when you stop and do this - whether they are friends, leaders or people you disagree with - these are moments that can help shape careers.
