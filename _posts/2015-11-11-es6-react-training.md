Recently, a bunch of people attended an online training course on ES6 & React hosted by O'Reilly and run by [Brian Holt](https://twitter.com/holtbt) of Reddit & Netflix fame. Both JavaScript (ES5 & ES6) and React are tools that we already use in some areas within the various development teams around the business. Even though some teams may work in the same department, we find that skillsets vary person to person. This course was a great opporunity not just for those in a development team, but anyone who wanted to bring their skills up to the next level.

At Sky Betting & Gaming, React is fast becoming our tool of choice for developing reactive user interfaces. Our Sky Vegas product uses React quite heavily, Sky Bet use it for a couple of features as does Sky Bingo and we're looking at how we can make the most of it on our other offerings. The benefits of React are vast and most importantly makes it easier for our Designers (who own the front-end) to create and update components without having to have an in-depth knowledge of the JavaScript core language. ES6 adds many new pieces of syntactic sugar and new features to the JavaScript language, like fat arrow functions, classes, promises and the spread operator. The Sky Vegas team are currently porting their existing ES5 JavaScript files over to ES6 because we like to keep up with new technologies and ways of doing things.

Personally, I tend to focus on architecture and back-end languages (mainly PHP) and give little time to the front-end tools that we use. Thus this course was a perfect way for me to up my game and get back up to speed with the way in which we do things. O'Reilly offered a group ticket which we used to stream the training on the projector within the Gaming Tribe area and lasted until 01:00 GMT (bearing in mind the course started at 16:00GMT, or 08:00PST). The training showed off the new features of ES6 and how to use them in creating React components. Since we were in the office for the entirety of the evening SBG provided a variety of Large Dominos Pizzas to keep the hunger at bay, along with various snacks and soft drinks.

O'Reilly were also kind enough to send us a whole bunch of swag (and what developer doesn't like swag?!).
