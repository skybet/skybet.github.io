## {{ page.title }}

It’s probably no great surprise that once again the BSides 2019 Badge is also a PCB.
 
However most people don’t get the chance to have fun with their badges until they get home, but as this years badge is all about interaction, SBG have teamed up with BSidesLeeds to help you actually take part on the day.
 
## What do you need?
 
The heart of the badge is a [LoRa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoRa) ESP32 Board. These were originally designed by Heltec as “[ESP32 OLED LoRa Development Boards](http://www.heltec.cn/project/wifi-lora-32/?lang=en)” intended for IoT device/sensor development. For this badge, an original or any of its 23mm pitch pin-compatible copies are fine.
 
While you can get them much cheaper from AliExpress, they are unlikely to arrive in time for the conference. If you are an Amazon Prime customer you can use the following links to get them quickly. Alternatively, any board with a compatible pin-out is likely to work.

If you're looking only to receive, then all you need is a USB power source (the SBG stand will have a limited number of free mini powerbanks available). If you want to transmit as well as receive then you'll need something to act as a keyboard interface and power source, a laptop with a USB cable works fine, but we’re sure some of you will come up with inventive alternatives.
 
It would be nice to solder them on the day, but the venue doesn’t allow for that, so the good news is, you can actually get it working without the badge.
 
## Then what?
 
Just turn up to the SBG Firmware Flashing Station (located in the sponsor area) with your LoRa board and we’ll drop the BSides Leeds 2019 challenge firmware on it, pass you some info on how to hook it up to a PC/Mac/Linux box and then let the magic begin.
